# Accounts

Accounts in SalesforceIQ generally represent companies or groups of people. Accounts can have any kind of relationship with your Organization - they could be leads, clients, former clients, or partners of your company.

The API can access all of your Organizationâ€™s Accounts, and all Accounts created by the API can be seen by your entire Organization. If you are trying to create an Account within a List please refer to the [List Items (Relationship) API endpoint](#list-items).
